	        	<br />  |----corpses now start off fresh, rot, and then decay to a point where they fill up the arena and cannot be interacted with. Bodies will change appearence to a skeleton and flash red/purple to indicate you are losing time to score points with this corpse.

	      	</li>
	      	<li>Planting your shovel on a corpse now highlights this corpse so that the player can easier see which corpse they are targeting.

	      	</li>
